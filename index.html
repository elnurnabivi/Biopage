        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          As a Junior Software Developer, I bring hands-on experience in web
          development, utilizing technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, applying
          these technologies to create responsive and intuitive web interfaces.
          My knowledge of these languages, combined with my passion for coding
          and problem-solving, allows me to contribute effectively to
          development teams and drive the execution of high-quality software
          solutions.
